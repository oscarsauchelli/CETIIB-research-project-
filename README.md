Python code for my CETIIB research project: AI enhancement of fluorescence microscopy data
- This repository contains the python scripts that I used throughout my research project to train a network to remove noise and blur from generic input images. 
- When exectuted, the run.py file trains the network on pairs of original and artificially degraded Div2k images.
- The options provided to the run.py execution command can be used to specify the depth as well as many other properties of the RCAN neural network that gets trained.
